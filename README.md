# JAVA + MAVEN + SPRING BOOT + ANGULAR + TYPE SCRIPT - SAMPLE APP!!!

## Please read all before you start!!!

### Hello everyone!

Welcome to my java + maven + spring boot + angular + type script sample app! 
First of all I need to say that I am <b>not yet</b> ;) a professional it programmer. 
This app is only to show my subjective example of what you can do when you learn mentioned above technologies.
And as well my own understanding and capabilities of what I am able to do with them.
All the work has been done for the purpose of future job interviews.
It is not perfect and I'm still facing some issues concerning the application.
If you will have any feedback on it you are more than welcome to share it with me!
I have used Intellij IDEA and Visual Studio Code when creating the project.

### what you should have to run the app

- java version "11.0.2"
- maven version "3.6.2"
- node.js version "12.14.1"
- npm version "6.13.4"
- angular version "8.2.14"
- angular materials and hammerjs

In the near future I am planning to upload docker image of the app.

### what you need to know 

Please build the app with the default profile or dev profile - prod profile not yet finished.

You can say the app is done with the online library motive.
At the star you should register a new user.
During registration you will be asked to pick a role from USER, ADMIN, CREATOR:
USER : 
- can log in, log out
- can see his user info
- can update his user info
- can search for the books
- can see the book details
- can borrow the chosen book and later return it
- can check for all earlier borrowed books
- can see his active borrow order details
ADMIN additionally :
- can add a new book
- can update the book
- can see all created users
- can see chosen user info
- can see all crated borrow orders
- can return a book from any chosen borrow order
CREATOR additionally : 
- can delete books or users
<b>This app uses remote MySQL database so please delete ONLY users or books which you have earlier created!!!</b>
After you register login to the app with credentials chosen at registration step.

Have in mind that you probably will encounter some errors but anyways have fun with the app!
