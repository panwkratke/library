# JAVA + MAVEN + SPRING BOOT + ANGULAR + TYPE SCRIPT - SAMPLE APP!!!

## Please read all before you start!!!

### Hello everyone!

Welcome to my java + maven + spring boot + angular + type script sample app! <br>
First of all I need to say that I am <b>not yet</b> ;) a professional it programmer. <br>
This app is only to show my subjective example of what you can do when you learn mentioned above technologies. <br>
And as well my own understanding and capabilities of what I am able to do with them. <br>
All the work has been done for the purpose of future job interviews. <br>
It is not perfect and I'm still facing some issues concerning the application. <br>
If you will have any feedback on it you are more than welcome to share it with me! <br>
I have used Intellij IDEA and Visual Studio Code when creating the project. <br>

### what you should have to run the app

- java version "11.0.2" <br>
- maven version "3.6.2" <br>
- node.js version "12.14.1" <br>
- npm version "6.13.4" <br>
- angular version "8.2.14" <br>
- angular materials and hammerjs <br>

In the near future I am planning to upload docker image of the app.

### what you need to know 

Please build the app with the default profile or dev profile - prod profile not yet finished.

You can say the app is done with the online library motive. <br>
At the star you should register a new user. <br>
During registration you will be asked to pick a role from USER, ADMIN, CREATOR: <br>

USER : <br>
- can log in, log out <br>
- can see his user info <br>
- can update his user info <br>
- can search for the books <br>
- can see the book details <br>
- can borrow the chosen book and later return it <br>
- can check for all earlier borrowed books <br>
- can see his active borrow order details <br>

ADMIN additionally : <br>
- can add a new book <br>
- can update the book <br>

- can return a book from any chosen borrow order <br>

CREATOR additionally : <br>
- can delete books or users <br>

<b>This app uses remote MySQL database so please delete ONLY users or books which you have earlier created!!!</b> <br>

After you register login to the app with credentials chosen at registration step.

Have in mind that you probably will encounter some errors but anyways have fun with the app!
